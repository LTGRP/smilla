# smilla

smilla is a SMIMEA aware milter.

It implements [draft-ietf-dane-smime](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/dane/draft-ietf-dane-smime/) as specified by the [IETF DANE WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dane/charter/).

smilla is written in Python. At the moment it uses a generic DNS RR. This will change once a dedicated resource record has been defined.

smilla is a joined effort between [sys4](https://sys4.de) and [Posteo.de](https://posteo.de).
